# Paketo Buildpackless Base Builder

## `paketobuildpacks/builder:buildpackless-base`

This builder uses the [Paketo Base Stack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/base-stack-release) (an Ubuntu bionic base image)
and contains **no buildpacks nor order groups**. To use this builder, you must specify buildpacks
at build time using whatever mechanisms your CNB platform of choice offers.

For example, with the `pack` CLI, use `--buildpack` as follows:
```
pack build dotnet-with-buildpackless-builder \
           --buildpack gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/dotnet-core \
           --builder gcr.io/paketo-buildpacks/builder:buildpackless-base

```

To see which versions of build and run images and the lifecycle
are contained within a given builder version, see the
[Releases](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/buildpackless-base-builder/releases) on this
repo. This information is also available in the `builder.toml`.

For more information about this builder and how to use it, visit the [Paketo
builder documentation](https://paketo.io/docs/builders/).  To learn about the
stack included in this builder, visit the [Paketo stack
documentation](https://paketo.io/docs/stacks/).
